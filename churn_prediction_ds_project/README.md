# 🧠 Customer Churn Prediction Project

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning pipeline for predicting customer churn using Python, Pandas, and scikit-learn. Ideal for portfolio use and beginner-level Data Scientist interviews.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
We want to predict whether a customer will churn (leave) based on historical data.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `notebooks/churn_model.ipynb` – Full EDA + model building
- `images/` – Plots like ROC curve, confusion matrix
- `data/` – (empty) Folder for CSV or dataset links

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter
2. Load your data into `data/`
3. Run each cell step-by-step
4. Review metrics and plots

## 💡 Notes
You can replace the dataset with Telco churn dataset, Kaggle churn, or your own CRM data.

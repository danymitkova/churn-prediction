# 🧠 Customer Churn Prediction Project

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning pipeline for predicting customer churn using Python, Pandas, and scikit-learn. Ideal for portfolio use and beginner-level Data Scientist interviews.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

We want to predict whether a customer will churn (i.e., stop using the service) based on historical customer data. This is a binary classification problem.
